# First model: coil with a core

In this tutorial you build, solve and analyze an **axisymmetric coil with a steel core**, similar to the FEMM
magnetostatics tutorial. At the end you will have the |B| map, the flux lines and the coil inductance. It takes
about ten minutes.

The model (dimensions in mm, r horizontal and z vertical):

| Part | r | z | Material |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core | 0 to 8 | −25 to 25 | 1010 steel (nonlinear) |
| Coil | 11 to 19 | −15 to 15 | Copper, 500 turns, 2 A |
| Air (domain) | 0 to 60 | −60 to 60 | Air |

The whole tutorial fits in a script. Paste the lines at the end of this page into the console (below the canvas),
one at a time or all at once through the [local bridge](../scripting/bridge.md), and watch the model being built.

## 1. Axisymmetric problem

Open the **Problem and libraries** drawer (on the right) and choose **Axisymmetric**. The vertical axis becomes the
symmetry axis (r = 0): the r < 0 half-plane is hatched because it lies outside the domain. MagFEM warns you if a
point is drawn there.

## 2. Geometry

1. With the **Line** tool (`L`), draw the domain outline: go up the axis from (0, −60) to (0, 60) and close the
   rectangle out to r = 60. Clicking near an axis snaps the point onto it.
2. Draw the core: from (0, −25) to (8, −25), (8, 25) and back to the axis at (0, 25). Touch the axis with the end
   points: the point snaps onto the axis line and gets a "point on" constraint.
3. With **Rectangle** (`R`), draw the coil from (11, −15) to (19, 15).
4. To lock the dimensions, use **Dimension** (`D`) and type the values (they accept units and expressions with
   variables).

:::{admonition} Why split the axis?
:class: note
The axis was drawn as three segments (below, beside and above the core). Overlapping lines in the same place do not
form regions; splitting the axis where the parts touch it lets each region close cleanly.

## 3. Materials, circuit and mesh

Under **Mesh › Materials**, each closed region shows up as "Region N".

1. Choose **Air** for the domain, **1010 steel** for the core and **Copper** for the coil. The list has a search box
   and includes the FEMM library.
2. Under **Mesh › Circuits**, click `+` and create the circuit **Coil**.
3. Select the coil region and, in its properties, connect it to the **Coil** circuit with **500 turns**.
4. The outer border already belongs to the **Dirichlet (A = 0)** boundary. In axisymmetric problems the axis also
   has A = 0.
5. Under **Mesh › Regions**, give the core and the coil 0.8 mm. Under **Elements**, use 2.5 mm as the default size
   and click ▶ to generate the mesh.

## 4. Solve

Under **Solver › Magnetic field**, in the **Currents** section, give the **Coil** circuit the current `I` (the
variable is 2 A). Then click the ▶ of **Magnetic field** (magnetostatic analysis). Since the steel has a B-H curve, the
problem is nonlinear and solved with Newton-Raphson; it takes less than a second.

## 5. Results

1. From the `+` of **Results › Magnetic field**, create a **Field map**. The view opens in a tab with the |B|
   surface; with the view's `+`, add an A **Contour** (the flux lines).
2. Create a **Table** and add the **Circuits** item: it shows current, turns, flux linkage λ, inductance L = λ/I,
   DC resistance and losses.

![|B| map and flux lines](../img/field-en.png)

With the mesh above, the result is λ ≈ 29.7 mWb and **L ≈ 14.9 mH**, with a peak |B| of about 0.51 T in the core.
The values change slightly with the mesh; refine it and watch them converge.

## 6. Try it

- Change the variable `I` to 10 A and solve again: the steel starts to saturate and L drops.
- Replace the steel with **Air** and compare the inductance (air core).
- Create a **Plot over line** along the axis to see B_z(z).

## The complete script

Materials can be referenced by id (`mat_air`, `mat_cu`, `mat_1010`), which works in both interface languages.
