# Introduction

**MagFEM** solves two-dimensional magnetic field problems with the finite element method, right in the browser.
It is meant for inductors, transformers, actuators, contactors and, later, rotating machines. Problems can be
**planar** (a cross-section with a depth) or **axisymmetric** (solids of revolution around the z axis).

- **No installation and no server.** The numerical core (C++ and Eigen) is compiled to WebAssembly and runs in a
  Web Worker. Your project stays on your machine, as in draw.io.
- **English and Portuguese**, light and dark themes, and the **Cite** button at the top.
- **Open source** (MIT) on [GitHub](https://github.com/thalesmaoa/magfem). Bugs and ideas:
  [issues](https://github.com/thalesmaoa/magfem/issues).

Open it at <https://thalesmaia.com/tools/magfem-web/>. It works best in Chrome or Edge, which can save straight to
the same file; in Firefox and Safari, saving becomes a download.

## The workflow

The tree on the left follows the order of the work, as in COMSOL:

1. **Geometry** — the parametric drawing (entities, constraints, dimensions and variables).
2. **Mesh** — region materials, circuits, boundaries, element size and the mesh.
3. **Solver** — the physics (magnetic field or circuit) and the analysis type.
4. **Results** — field views, plots and tables, each one in a canvas tab.

## The interface

| Area | Contents |
|---|---|
| Top bar | New, Open, Save, Save as, Import, Export, Cite, language (PT/EN) and theme |
| Toolbar | drawing, constraints, dimension and editing (trim, offset, mirror, patterns), move and group |
| Model tree | the four stages; each node's `+` creates items; double-click renames |
| Properties | below the tree: the properties of the selection |
| Canvas | the drawing and the result tabs (views, plots, tables, schematic) |
| Right drawer | **Problem and libraries**: unit, planar/axisymmetric, depth, materials and boundaries |
| Console | every action shows up as an API command; typed commands work too |
| Status bar | coordinates, degrees of freedom, hints, **Local script**, Bug reports and the version |

## Next steps

- Build the [first model](./first-model.md): an axisymmetric coil with a steel core, from the drawing to the inductance.
- Learn how to draw and constrain the [geometry](./geometry.md).
- Automate with the [console](../scripting/console.md) and the [local bridge](../scripting/bridge.md).
