# Local bridge (Python)

MagFEM runs in the browser, but it can be driven by **scripts on your computer**: change variables, solve, read
results and rebuild the geometry while you watch the model change live. This enables parameter sweeps, optimization
and couplings the app does not have (mechanics, thermal…).

Since a web page cannot accept connections, a small program on your machine acts as the bridge: the **local bridge**
(`python -m magfem`). The page connects to it over WebSocket, and scripts talk to it over HTTP.

```
script (Python, Matlab, Julia, curl…) ──HTTP──▶ bridge (127.0.0.1:8765) ◀──WebSocket── MagFEM page
```

## Install

Requires Python 3.9 or newer; the package only uses the standard library.

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/thalesmaoa/magfem#subdirectory=bridge/python"
```

To update: `pip install -U "git+https://github.com/thalesmaoa/magfem#subdirectory=bridge/python"`.

## Connect

1. In a terminal, run the bridge. With `--key` you choose the key (without it, a new key is generated every time):

   ```bash
   python -m magfem --key my-key
   ```

2. In the app, click **Local script** (status bar, bottom right), check the port (8765) and paste the key. The app
   remembers the last port and key.

3. The terminal reports that the page connected and opens the `magfem>` console.

## The terminal console

With the page connected, `python -m magfem` becomes a console tied to the app, like the web console:

```
MagFEM bridge 1.0.3 em http://127.0.0.1:8765
  No app: clique em 'Script local', porta 8765, chave: my-key
  Esperando a página conectar… (Ctrl+C encerra)
● Página do MagFEM conectada. Digite comandos do console (help() lista; Ctrl+D sai).
  Scripts em outro terminal: mf = magfem.connect(key="my-key")
magfem> g.circle((0, 0), r=5)
  "c4"
```

(The bridge messages are in Portuguese for now.)

- **Tab** completes commands, ids and variables (the suggestions come from the page);
- **↑** repeats commands; **Ctrl+D** leaves; **Ctrl+C** stops the bridge;
- the prompt only shows while the page is connected; if it drops, the console waits for it to reconnect;
- commands sent by scripts show up tagged `[script]`.

Use `--no-console` for the bridge alone, without the console.

## Python scripts

With the bridge running in one terminal, a script in another terminal connects with the same key:

```python
import magfem

mf = magfem.connect(key="my-key")        # waits for the page to connect
mf.set_var("I", "5")                     # project variable
mf.solve()                               # meshes if needed, solves and waits
print(mf.result("Coil_L"))               # number of a result variable
print(mf.results())                      # {name: (value, unit)}
t, i = mf.series("Coil_I")               # transient: curve over time
mf.run('g.circle((0, 0), r=5)')          # any console line (or several, separated by \n)
```

Without a bridge already running, `magfem.connect()` starts one inside the script itself and prints the port and key.

| Method | Does |
|---|---|
| `magfem.connect(port=8765, key=None, wait=True, timeout=None)` | connects (or starts the bridge) and waits for the page |
| `mf.run(code)` | runs console lines; returns the value of the last one |
| `mf.set_var(name, expr)` | `g.var(name, expr)` |
| `mf.solve(physics=None)` | solves and waits for it to finish |
| `mf.result(name, physics=None)` | value of a result variable |
| `mf.results(physics=None)` | `{name: (value, unit)}` |
| `mf.series(name)` | `(times, values)` in transient analysis |
| `mf.status()` | `{"browser": bool, "version": ...}` |

### Errors

A command that fails in the app raises `magfem.BridgeError` with the message and the failing line. With `timeout`,
waiting for the page also ends in this error:

```python
import magfem

try:
    mf = magfem.connect(key="my-key", timeout=60)
    mf.run("g.circle((0, 0), r=5)")
    mf.solve()
    print(mf.result("Fx"))
except magfem.BridgeError as e:
    print("MagFEM:", e)
```

`s.solve()` and `m.generate()` finish before the next line starts, so a script can chain commands without waiting by
hand.

## Security

- The bridge only listens on `127.0.0.1` (your machine).
- It only accepts WebSocket connections from MagFEM pages (thalesmaia.com or localhost).
- Every HTTP command needs the **key** in the `X-MagFEM-Key` header. There is no empty key: without one, any program
  on your machine, or a malicious page open in the browser, could send commands.

## Plain HTTP

Any language that speaks HTTP can use the bridge. See [Matlab, Julia and HTTP](./other-languages.md).
